Create: Thermantics adds a new temperature system to minecraft that is fully integrated with the create mod.

Temperature is defined on a scale from 0 to 60 with 6 levels:
- FREEZING: 0-10 (Hypothermia III)
- COLD: 10-20 (Hypothermia II)
- CHILLY: 20-30 (Hypothermia I)
- WARM: 30-40 (This the optimal temperature for the player)
- HOT: 40-50 (Hyperthermia I)
- FIERY: 50-60 (Hyperthermia II)

The effects Hypothermia and Hyperthermia are designed to make staying in too hot or too cold environments unattractive, but not too annoying. 

## How do I surivive the nether?
To survive the nether, especially in the early game, potions of thermal clemency are needed. Those potions will temporarily allow you to withstand extreme temperatures and can either be brewed or **found in every ruined portal chest**.
Netherite armor is the only armor that can fully protect you from too high temperatures in the nether.

## How do I survive in too hot / too cold environments?
All blocks that would emit heat or cool you down in reallife also do so in Create: Thermantics. Examples are furnaces, fluids like lava, campfires, encased fans (depending on the catalyst) and many more. 

Armor also helps with warming up / cooling down, but the effect is not too big.

Create: Thermantics also introduces a new block: The Thermal Exchanger.
The thermal exchanger can transfer the heat of thermal fluids to the environment. Therefore, Create: Thermantics adds 3 new thermal fluids:
- Scorching Compund
- Superheated Scorching Compound
- Frigid Compound

Depending on the thermal fluid you provide the thermal exchanger with, the temperature around the thermal exchanger will be heated up or cooled down.

The thermal exchanger outputs temperature-neutral versions of the input fluid, which can be recycled to be used again.

## Can I configure Create: Thermantics?
Yes. Nearly all numbers and values can be configured in the config. It is recommended to change the config through Creates config system.

## Compatability
Create: Thermantics mainly uses the biome teperature attribute from vanilla minecraft. That should make it compatible with most mods that add new biomes to the game. 
If you have suggestions regarding compatibility, let me know via discord.
